# Hi there! 👋

My name is Jacob, but most websites know me as **FloatingJacob** (long story).  

I’m a 14-year-old noob software dev. I use **AI** for my Python projects, and my brain for the rest (mostly).


I’m far from a pro, and yes, my code probably has more inefficiencies than **Meta** (somehow).

## ⚠️ Warning

- Do not attempt to debug alone.  
- May induce severe rage or trigger OCD (David Adam, back off).

## 🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

- **[PIXEL](https://github.com/FloatingJacob/PIXEL)** – My favorite project so far. It converts files to a .png which looks really garbled. (It's cooler after you [try it](https://github.com/FloatingJacob/PIXEL)).  
- **aMogusManager** – A work-in-progress Among Us mod manager that will probably hospitalize you if you look at the source code.
