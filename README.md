Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jacob, but almost all my internet accounts are called FloatingJacob (long story) anyways, im a noob software developer that uses AI for all my python projects, and my brain for the rest.


I am far from a pro software developer (im only 14) and i try showing it through my horrendous GUIs in some of my GUI programs.


My favorite project that i have 'made' so far is something i am calling CENO. Check it out at https://github.com/Floatingjacob/Ceno


Some programming languages that i have dabbled in are: C#.NET, python, C++ (for arduino-type boards), HTML (Mudblazor), VB.NET, SQL (is it even a programming language?), and javascript (very limited)
